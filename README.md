This plugin helps you to add/manage icons with a nice way.

##### You can use every fonts/icons now.

### - Features
###### Why you need to use

> `A Problem of the Designer:` 
> When a designer wants to add an icon from icon fonts (like material, fontawesome, etc.) you need to find a cheatsheet to copy it in your design file or need to use a another application.

- You can easily add all icons without another application!

> `A Problem of the Developer:` 
> When a developer wants to learn name of the icon which is added by designer, you need to look too much icons to find it.

- You can easily learn it without any search.
