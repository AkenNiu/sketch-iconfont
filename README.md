Its a nice plugin to use icon fonts in Sketch for developers and designers.

Now it support font awesome and material icons but sure, I would like to add more. Maybe I can create a custom(like flat) icon font uploader to this plugin.

## Demo

# Features

> `A Problem of the Designer:` 
> When you want to add an icon from icon fonts, you don't need to find a cheatsheet to copy it in your design.

- You can easily add it now in sketch.

> `A Problem of the Developer:` 
> When you want to learn the alias of the icon which is added from a designer, you don't need to look all of too much icons to find it.

- You can easily learn it now in sketch.

# Install

1. Download ZIP of this repo.
2. Extract and rename folder to what would you like.
3. Put the folder in your Sketch plugin folder (Use `Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder` to find the plugin folder).

# Dependencies

1. You need to install icon fonts to your os system. You can download from here.

For fontawesome:
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/raw/master/fonts/FontAwesome.otf

For materialicon:
https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/iconfont/MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf

# Problem

It's not working with sketch beta. Because sketch beta is not supporting NSFont, I'll be fix it when it will be finished.

# Note

I've started to develop this plugin after https://github.com/keremciu/sketch-use-fontawesome this plugin. I'd like to add more icon font support. If you want to some icon font, you can create an issue about it. I hope you like it :)
